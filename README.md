## Cheminformatics of Unknown, Variable, Complex, and Biological (UVCB) substances

Introduction to project and motivation (Clark paper). 

## Research Questions and First steps of this project (Mixtures Github, understanding the STRUCTURE of mixfiles and MInChIs)

1. To what extent can UVCBs (mixtures) be encoded in machine-readable formats i.e., as MInChIs?
2. What challenges exist in encoding MInChIs using currently available UVCB data? 
3. How can UVCB data providers improve the communication and dissemination of UVCB compounds?


Overview of file formats and how to approach the research questions
